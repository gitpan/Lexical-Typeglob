Lexical/Typeglob version 0.02
=============================

DESCRIPTION
    "Lexical::Typeglob::lexglob" creates an anonymous glob and returns a
    reference to it. Such a glob reference can be used as a file or
    directory handle. This differs from "Symbol::gensym" only in that the
    glob has no symbol table component and the glob generation is four
    times as fast.

INSTALLATION
